                <p>Hello! I'm Laura, I'm 32 and I'm from Salt Lake City. I love to learn new things. I've studied Nursing, 
                Graphic Design, Data Analysis, Broadcasting and even Physics! I have a tendency to get bored with things
                and move on to something completely different every few years. So this is my new thing for the next few 
                years! Since coding is always growing, I don't think I'll get bored! There is always something new to learn. 
                I'm looking forward to adding coding to my list of random things I know.</p>
                <p>I live in an adorable two-bed two-bath townhouse in Murray. I bought it as a foreclosure and had to 
                completely renovate it, it was stressful but fun. My roommate is my 10-year old black lab, Kaiya. She's not a great roommate, she’s very messy 
                and has terrible gas, but I love her! I've had her since she was a puppy, she's always been nuts. She is great at being the mama 
                dog to the puppies I foster. I like to say she teaches them how to "dog".</p>
                <p>I have worked in Radio for the past 5 years, and it's been a wild ride. There is so much I love about radio; it is an incredibly fun and 
                unique work experience. There aren't a lot of workplaces that let you wear jeans and chucks, listen to loud music, meet artists, and go 
                to awesome concerts and events. It's so fun, but you can't be in it for the money because there isn’t much of it.</p>
